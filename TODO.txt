Story:
1) Can we link to linear encoding, 

2) Design of Unitary Matrix optimally

3) Comparing data manifolds???
- highest eigenvecotr
- can we determine it from the rotation given by U, what angle theta (is it pi/2)

Try a unitary transformation that swaps first and last eigenvector
-> First write a matrix in a basis of the highest and lowest eigenvector than convert to real numbers
-->> Normalize v_max and v_min, then take space spaned by them, check email from Nidhal
